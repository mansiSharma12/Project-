I am primarily working on India DoT workflow. A week before last ,the DLP issue got resolved , now I am working on it on priority basis and aiming to complete the v1 testing by end of next week hopefully.

Next we had this requirement of creating gitlab issues from SharePoint. We delivered the powershell script on adhoc basis but I have been reading the Amelia documentation to a workflow on Amelia itself . 
Then for login enterprise, I created the workload for onedrive yesterday and currently it's in testing phase.
