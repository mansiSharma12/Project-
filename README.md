Before we go through the PA workflow let's take a look at the visio diagram. It basically has three sections . First we are fetching the users from BBS ad groups and populating the records in voice UBS. Second part is where we are applying all the compliance checks and then there comes the third part where we will update the SharePoint compliance status along with the mail to non- compliant users.okay so it is the high level process.

This is how it is implemented in power automate.
