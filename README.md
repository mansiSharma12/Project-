**Key Achievements and Contributions:**

1. **Developed Synthetic Monitoring Scripts**: I successfully created synthetic monitoring scripts for the majority of M365 applications, even though I had no prior experience with PowerShell. I was assigned five scripts, and I completed three, demonstrating my ability to quickly learn and apply new skills.

2. **Amelia Workflow for GitLab Issues**: After undergoing training on the Amelia automation platform, I developed a workflow that creates GitLab issues by leveraging the Graph API. This project was part of a larger initiative aimed at automating issue creation from SharePoint data, and my contribution was pivotal in driving the automation process forward.

3. **India DoT Non-compliance Reporting Workflow**: I took ownership of and developed the most critical Power Automate workflow for India DoT non-compliance reporting. Despite starting with little experience in Power Automate, I quickly learned the tool and successfully delivered a solution that met the compliance requirements.

4. **Collaboration and Learning**: Throughout the year, I actively collaborated with peers and cross-functional teams, particularly on monitoring app scripts. I consistently sought opportunities to expand my skill set, which has contributed to my growth in automation technologies and workflow optimization.
