To document the test cases in Excel for your Power Automate workflow, you can create a structured format to clearly outline each use case and its expected behavior. Hereâ€™s a suggested approach for your test cases:

### Excel Columns:
1. **Test Case ID**: A unique identifier for each test case (e.g., TC_01, TC_02, etc.).
2. **Test Case Description**: A brief description of the scenario being tested.
3. **Pre-Conditions**: Any initial setup or conditions needed before testing (e.g., user email, public IP, etc.).
4. **Test Steps**: The actions to be performed in the test case.
5. **Input Data**: The specific data being used for the test (e.g., email, public IP, base IP, subnet, etc.).
6. **Expected Result**: The outcome you expect if the test passes (e.g., compliant or non-compliant).
7. **Actual Result**: What actually happens when the test is performed.
8. **Status**: Pass/Fail depending on whether the actual result matches the expected result.
9. **Comments**: Any notes or observations from the test (e.g., issues encountered).

### Example Rows:
| Test Case ID | Test Case Description                                  | Pre-Conditions                 | Test Steps                                            | Input Data                             | Expected Result                          | Actual Result | Status | Comments |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------|--------|----------|
| TC_01        | Verify compliance when call location matches base location | User base location is Singapore | 1. Fetch user email from SharePoint list. <br> 2. Fetch call location and base location. <br> 3. Check if call location matches base location. | Email: user1@example.com <br> Call Location: Singapore <br> Base Location: Singapore | User should be marked as compliant.       | Compliant      | Pass   |           |
| TC_02        | Verify if call location is Singapore and client column contains 'windows' | User base location is Singapore | 1. Fetch user email and client column from SharePoint list. <br> 2. Check if location is Singapore and if 'windows' exists in the client column. | Email: user2@example.com <br> Call Location: Singapore <br> Client: Windows 10 | User should be marked as compliant.       | Compliant      | Pass   |           |
| TC_03        | Verify compliance for Zurich location and subnet matching base IP | User base location is Zurich    | 1. Fetch user email and subnet from SharePoint list. <br> 2. Check if subnet matches user base IP. | Email: user3@example.com <br> Call Location: Zurich <br> Subnet: 192.168.1.0/24 | User should be marked as non-compliant. | Non-compliant  | Pass   |           |

You can adjust the test steps and input data based on the actual details of your workflow and the test cases you have already created in SharePoint.
