I have to fill my performance review year end. I will tell you what I did you have to give me draft of what are my achievements and what are the opportunities to develop. So I have created synthetic monitoring scripts for most of the m365 applications. I didn't have any knowledge of powershell so I was given 5 scripts of which I was able to complete 3.Amelia is a new automation platform. I did the training and managed to make a workflow which creates gitlab issues using graph API. Now that issue part is a part ofa project which aims to create a gitlab issues by fetching data from SharePoint. I owned and created the most important power automate workflow for India DoT non-compliance reporting even though I was once a beginner in that. In future, I would love to take tasks in azure and Amelia.

Here’s a draft for your performance review, focusing on achievements and opportunities for development:

Achievements:
PowerShell Scripting: Despite having no prior knowledge of PowerShell, you successfully completed 3 out of 5 assigned synthetic monitoring scripts for M365 applications, showcasing your adaptability and ability to learn new technologies quickly.
Automation with Amelia: After training on Amelia, a new automation platform, you designed a workflow that integrates with GitLab using the Graph API. This demonstrates your ability to leverage emerging platforms for process automation.
GitLab Automation Project: Played a critical role in a project aimed at creating GitLab issues by fetching data from SharePoint. Your contribution has been vital in automating issue creation and enhancing workflow efficiency.
India DoT Non-compliance Reporting: You led the development of the most important Power Automate workflow for India DoT non-compliance reporting. This was a significant achievement, especially considering your initial lack of experience with Power Automate, showing tremendous growth in workflow automation.
Opportunities for Development:
Further Development in PowerShell: While you made significant progress, continuing to build your expertise in PowerShell would allow you to handle more complex automation tasks with confidence.
Azure Expertise: With a keen interest in taking on future tasks involving Azure, gaining in-depth knowledge of Azure services such as Logic Apps, Functions, and Event Hubs would be a great next step in advancing your technical skills.
Advanced Amelia Automation: Expanding your knowledge of Amelia to create more complex, multi-system integrated workflows will enhance your capability 
to handle diverse automation scenarios.
